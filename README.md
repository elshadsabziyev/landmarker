## 🚀 Introduction

LoBot (Location Bot) is a Python-based application utilizing the Google Cloud Vision API for landmark detection in images. This system enables users to upload images, identify landmarks within them, retrieve the landmark's name, acquire its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and display the detected landmarks on a map using the Folium library.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing landmarks for recognition.
- **Landmark Detection**: Utilizes Google Cloud Vision API for landmark recognition in images.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Retrieves geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of detected landmarks.
- **Interactive Map Display**: Shows detected landmarks on an interactive map using Folium library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the application.
- **Google Cloud Vision API**: For landmark detection in images.
- **Folium**: Python library for creating interactive maps.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for building the user interface.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for image processing and display.

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lobot-location-bot.git
    cd lobot-location-bot
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment (recommended):
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / MacOS
     .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
     ```
   - Install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup**:
   - Create a GCP project and enable the Vision API.
   - Obtain API key or service account credentials for Vision API access.
   - Set the credentials as environmental variables:
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/credentials.json  # Linux / MacOS
     set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/credentials.json    # Windows
     ```

4. **Running the Application**:
   - Run the Streamlit application by executing:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main.py
     ```
   - Access the application through the provided URL (usually on `http://localhost:8501`).

5. **Using the Application**:
   - Once the application is running, you'll be prompted to upload an image containing a landmark.
   - After uploading the image, the system will use Google Cloud Vision API to detect the landmark.
   - Detected landmarks will be displayed along with their names, confidence scores, and geographical coordinates on an interactive map generated using Folium.

6. **Note**:
   - Ensure stable internet connectivity for Google Cloud Vision API usage.
   - Properly configure Streamlit's secrets.toml or environment variables for API key/secrets handling.

## 🔧 Usage

For deploying the application on Streamlit Sharing or other hosting platforms:

1. **Streamlit Deployment**:
   - Ensure the application is properly configured for deployment.
   - Sign up for Streamlit Sharing or choose a hosting platform of your choice.
   - Follow platform-specific instructions to deploy the application.

For local usage on Windows or other operating systems, follow similar steps provided in the installation section with respective command syntax adjustments.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components

- **Google Cloud Vision API**: Handles landmark detection in images.
- **Python Backend**: Utilizes Streamlit to create the user interface and Folium for map generation.
- **Folium Map**: Used to display detected landmarks on an interactive map.

### Workflow

1. User uploads an image through the Streamlit interface.
2. Python backend sends the image data to the Google Cloud Vision API for landmark detection.
3. The API returns landmark information (name and coordinates).
4. Folium library creates an interactive map and displays the detected landmark.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🚀 Version 1.0.0 (Current Release)

- **Basic Functionality**:
  - Landmark detection and mapping features implemented.
  - Local deployment and usage instructions provided.

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **📡 Improved API Integration**:
